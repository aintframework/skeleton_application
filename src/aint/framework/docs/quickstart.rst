This guide will showcase an implementation of a typical CRUD web application, using **aint framework**.
This demo is hugely inspired by the `Zend Framework 2 Getting Started Example <http://zf2.readthedocs.org/en/latest/user-guide/overview.html>`_ and solves the same task in a similar way. If you like ZF2 and has done that tutorial, you will be able to compare the approaches and the amount of coding needed.

To proceed with the demo, all you need is PHP 5.4 installed in your system and `php_pdo_sqlite` extension enabled.
