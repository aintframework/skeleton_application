Controllers and Routing
=======================
Skeleton application uses ``aint\mvc\routing\route_segment`` function for routing. We'll use it for our four new pages as well. We'll create a package to hold the action functions: ``/src/app/controller/actions/albums.php`` and add there the ones that we need:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    namespace app\controller\actions\albums;

    function list_action($request, $params) {

    }

    function add_action($request, $params) {

    }

    function edit_action($request, $params) {

    }

    function delete_action($request, $params) {

    }

Notice, here and further the name of the package file always corresponds to the namespace. It is by convention we use for this demo and for the framework itself. (Nothing is enforced in **aint framework**).

``route_segment`` will route ``/albums/add`` uri to ``app\controller\actions\albums\add_action`` function. ``$request`` holds data about the current HTTP request, while ``$params`` contains parameters of the route. For instance, ``/albums/edit/id/123`` will be routed to ``app\controller\actions\albums\edit_action`` with ``$params`` = ``['id' => 123]``.

We'll need to "enable" the new actions namespace by adding it to ``app\controller``:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    // actions
    require_once 'app/controller/actions/index.php';
    require_once 'app/controller/actions/errors.php';
    require_once 'app/controller/actions/albums.php'; // - adding this

To make the application list albums on the index page instead of the default "Welcome" page, we'll change the ``app\controller\actions\index\index_action`` like this:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    function index_action() {
        // does nothing, simply delegates
        return \app\controller\actions\albums\list_action();
    }

To have all this working now, we'll also need to create some simple templates and have them rendered. Create these four files and leave them empty for now:

* ``/src/app/view/templates/albums/add.phtml``
* ``/src/app/view/templates/albums/edit.phtml``
* ``/src/app/view/templates/albums/delete.phtml``
* ``/src/app/view/templates/albums/list.phtml``

And make the change in the controllers:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    namespace app\controller\actions\albums;

    // including the app's view package to be able to render response:
    require_once 'app/view.php';
    use app\view;

    function list_action() {
        return view\render('albums/list');
    }

    function add_action($request) {
        return view\render('albums/add');
    }

    function edit_action($request, $params) {
        return view\render('albums/edit');
    }

    function delete_action($request, $params) {
        return view\render('albums/delete');
    }

Make sure the following links work:
`Index/List <http://localhost:8080/>`_ | `Add <http://localhost:8080/albums/add>`_ | `Edit <http://localhost:8080/albums/edit>`_ | `Delete <http://localhost:8080/albums/delete>`_

By the way, you can make sure the default error handler also works: `<http://localhost:8080/badurl>`_

Let's now drop in some logic, i.e. :doc:`The Model </quickstart/model>`
