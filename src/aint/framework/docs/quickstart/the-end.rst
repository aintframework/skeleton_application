Covering your application with tests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Whether you prefer TDD or cover the code with test after you have written it: both are perfectly possible with **aint framework**.

While adding tests to your application is not covered in this particular Quick Start, feel free to check some of these additional resources on testing:

`PHPUnit Manual <http://www.phpunit.de/manual/3.7/en/index.html>`_

`aint framework tests <https://github.com/aintframework/aint_framework/tree/master/tests>`_
